### What I learned

Working through this challenge was a lot of fun. It dealt a lot with creating
layout using CSS. This was something that I knew was possible but never tried it
myself. Learning how to make the triangle piece for the GB left box was also very
interesting.

```
.tri {
  /////
  height: 0px;
  width: 0px;
  border-top: 30px solid transparent;
  border-bottom: 30px solid transparent;
  border-right: 30px solid var(--neut-400);
}
```
